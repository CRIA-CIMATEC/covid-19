# Chest X ray Deep Learning tool – COVID-19

## COVID Model

<p>The model has the function, given an chest x-ray image with anomaly, to assess the probability of this being a case of suspected COVID-19 or not.</p>

<p>Such as the anomaly detection model, this model makes use of the Inception V3 architecture, as modifications in the last layers. Model was trained with 8493 images where 20% were allocated for validation and 10% for testing.</p>
