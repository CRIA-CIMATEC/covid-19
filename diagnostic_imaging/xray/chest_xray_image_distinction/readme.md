# Artificial Neural Network for chest X-ray image distinction

## Support for Covid diagnosis using Aritificial Intelligence in Computed Tomography imagess

### Reference Center for Artificial Intelligence at SENAI CIMATEC

Model was trained to distinguish 3 classes: (A) X-ray of the chest, (B) X-ray of other parts of the body and (C) any images

In chest_xray_image_distinction there are two model: (i) model trained for cross valdiation and (ii) model trained for production.

The model's training, validation and test data set came from the following bases:
A. [NIH Chest X-rays](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data);
B. [IRMA X-ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/raddar/irma-xray-dataset);
C. [Commom Objects in Contest (COCO)](https://cocodataset.org/#home).
