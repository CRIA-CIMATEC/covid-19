Artificial Neural Network for chest CT image distinction

Model was trained to distinguish 3 classes: (A) CT of the chest, (B) CT of other parts of the body and (C) any images

In chest_CT_image_distinction there are two model: (i) model trained for cross valdiation and (ii) model trained for production.

The model's training, validation and test dataset came from the following databases:
A. [Medical Segmentation Decathlon + MosMedData](https://mosmed.ai/en/);
B. [Medical Segmentation Decathlon](http://medicaldecathlon.com/);
C. [Commom Objects in Contest (COCO)](https://cocodataset.org/#home).
