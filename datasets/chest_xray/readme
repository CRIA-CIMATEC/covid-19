The dataset has 1158 AP chest radiographs from patients from a hospital in Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil, obtained in the period between July and September of 2020.

(1) Normal - normal examination
(2) Viral Grave - severe viral infection
(3) Viral Moderado - moderate viral infection
(4) Viral Leve - mild viral infection
(5) Bacteriana Grave - severe bacterial infection
(6) Bacteriana Moderado - moderate bacterial infection
(7) Bacteriana Leve - mild bacterial infection
(8) Excluido - Lack of consensus

The spreadsheet presents the outputs of the CIMATEC_XCOV19 and DEEPCOVID_XR AI algorithm for each image in the dataset.
