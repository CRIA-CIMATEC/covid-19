# Advanced Processing and Artificial Intelligence to Fight COVID-19

During a 4-month period, provide a supercomputing and artificial intelligence environment, develop and operate support solutions to fight COVID-19 in the areas of biological sciences, imaging tests and pandemic evolution predictions.

Specific objectives:

<ul>
  <li>1- HPC to assist researchers in developing research to fight COVID-19.</li>

<li>2- Develop a tool to support the diagnosis of medical images from CT and X-ray imaging exams, aiming to identify the presence of COVID-19 using deep learning methods.</li>

<li>3- Develop a decision support and forecasting tool to predict confirmed cases, deaths and economic variables, based on historical data from other countries and Brazilian states, and on the results obtained by other countries' containment measures. The system will allow the risk analysis of scenarios and the simulation of the results of containment measures, evaluating their effects on the propagation of the pandemic in the short term.</li>
</ul>
